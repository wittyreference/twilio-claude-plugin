# Twilio Sync

Real-time state synchronization via four primitives: Documents (single JSON objects), Lists (ordered collections), Maps (key-value stores), and Streams (ephemeral pub/sub). Covers data type selection, TTL lifecycle, conflict resolution, MCP tool coverage, and error handling.

Evidence date: 2026-03-25. Account prefix: ACb4de. Service: IS8d793d.

> **WARNING: Slash characters in Map keys cause silent data loss.** Keys containing `/` can be created but cannot be fetched, updated, or deleted via REST API or MCP tools. They become permanently orphaned. The MCP `add_sync_map_item` tool validates against this. See Gotcha #5.

## Scope

### CAN

- Store JSON state in Documents (single mutable objects, up to 16 KiB) <!-- verified: ETf6783d -->
- Append-only ordered items in Lists (auto-indexed, up to 1M items per list) <!-- verified: ES0251800d -->
- Key-value lookups in Maps (string keys up to 320 chars, up to 1M items per map) <!-- verified: MPd79ca1ac -->
- Fire-and-forget pub/sub via Streams (ephemeral, max 4 KiB per message)
- TTL on all object types: 0–31,536,000 seconds (0 = no expiry) <!-- verified: ETccd0ec2d, 10s TTL enforced within 15s -->
- Per-item TTL on List items and Map items independent of parent container TTL <!-- verified: ES0251800d, item dateExpires=null with parent TTL active -->
- `collectionTtl` on item operations to reset parent container's TTL (keep-alive pattern) <!-- verified: ES65f9bb08, parent expiry reset from 22:54:58 to 22:56:42 -->
- Conditional updates via `If-Match` header with revision string (optimistic concurrency) <!-- verified: ETf6783d, revision "1" matched, "0" rejected with 54103 -->
- Webhook events for all CRUD operations on Documents, Lists, Maps, and Streams
- Access documents/lists/maps/streams by SID or UniqueName interchangeably in URL paths <!-- verified: all tests used uniqueName in MCP tools -->
- Documents without uniqueName (SID-only access) <!-- verified: ETc9642713 -->
- List items with `order` (asc/desc) and `from` (index) query params for pagination <!-- verified: ES0251800d, order=desc returned 4,2,0; from=2 returned 2,4 -->
- Map items with `order` (asc/desc) and `from` (key) query params for pagination (REST API only; MCP `list_sync_maps` does not expose these)
- Unicode and special characters in Map keys (dots, accented characters) <!-- verified: MPd79ca1ac, "key.with.dots" and "émoji-café-naïve" both work -->
- Empty object `{}` as valid Document data <!-- verified: ETc9642713 -->

### CANNOT

<!-- verified: all CANNOT items live-tested 2026-03-25 unless noted -->

- **No merge/patch updates** — Document and Map Item updates are full replacement. Updating `{theme: "light"}` on a document containing `{theme: "dark", version: "1.0", nested: {key: "value"}}` produces `{theme: "light"}` — the other fields are gone. Read-modify-write is required for partial updates. <!-- verified: ETf6783d, version and nested keys lost -->
- **No arbitrary List index insertion** — List indices are append-only. You cannot insert at a specific position. Indices are non-contiguous after deletions and never reused. After adding items 0,1,2, deleting 1, the next item gets index 4 (not 1 or 3). <!-- verified: ES0251800d -->
- **No upsert on Map items** — `add_sync_map_item` (create) errors with 54208 if the key exists. You must use `update_sync_map_item` for existing keys. This is NOT a set-or-create operation. <!-- verified: MPd79ca1ac, "An Item with given key already exists" -->
- **No slash characters in Map keys** — Keys containing `/` can be created but **cannot be individually fetched, updated, or deleted** via REST API because the slash is interpreted as a URL path separator. They become orphaned — visible only via list/validate operations. This applies to both MCP tools and direct REST calls. <!-- verified: MPd79ca1ac, "key/with/slashes" created OK, get/remove returns "Parameter 'key' is not valid" -->
- **Stream messages are not persisted** — No fetch, list, update, or delete operations exist. Messages are fire-and-forget with no delivery guarantee and no ordering guarantee. Max 30 msg/s per stream. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/api/stream-message-resource -->
- **MCP Stream tools cover lifecycle and publish only** — `create_sync_stream`, `list_sync_streams`, `delete_sync_stream`, and `publish_stream_message` are available via MCP. Stream messages themselves cannot be fetched, updated, or deleted (they are ephemeral).
- **No `delete_sync_map` MCP tool** — Maps can only be deleted via REST API (`DELETE /v1/Services/{ServiceSid}/Maps/{MapSid}`, returns 204). <!-- verified: had to use curl to delete MPd79ca1ac -->
- **No conditional updates via MCP** — `If-Match` header for optimistic concurrency is REST-only. MCP update tools always perform unconditional last-write-wins. <!-- verified: MCP tool schemas have no ifMatch/revision parameter -->
- **No `get_sync_list` or `get_sync_map` MCP tools** — Cannot fetch container metadata (revision, dateExpires) via MCP. Use `validate_sync_list` / `validate_sync_map` as a workaround.
- **No `get_sync_list_item` MCP tool** — Cannot fetch a single List item by index via MCP. Use `list_sync_list_items` with `from` param as a workaround.
- **TTL enforcement is not instantaneous** — Twilio docs say "there can be a delay between the expiration time and the resource's deletion." In practice, enforcement is prompt (10s TTL gone within 15s), but do not rely on exact-second deletion. <!-- verified: ETccd0ec2d expired within 15s of 10s TTL -->
- **Write rate degrades with payload size** — Sustained 20 writes/s per object for small payloads. Objects >1 KiB face stricter limits; 10 KiB+ capped at 2 writes/s. Stream messages >3 KiB capped at 7 msg/s. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/limits -->

## Quick Decision

| Need | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Call state across webhooks | Document per CallSid with TTL | Single mutable object, predictable name, auto-cleanup |
| Configuration / settings | Document with uniqueName | Simple key-value, fetch by name |
| Activity feed / event log | List with TTL | Ordered, append-only, paginate with `order=desc` |
| User sessions / presence | Map with item TTL | Key per user, independent expiry per item |
| Real-time typing indicators | Stream | Ephemeral, no persistence needed |
| Payment state tracking | Document (polled by name) | Agent server polls document by well-known name |
| Queue of work items | List | Ordered, process from index 0, remove after processing |
| Feature flags / config store | Map | Key per flag, update independently |
| Temporary test validation | Document with 24h TTL | Callback logging, auto-cleanup |

## Decision Frameworks

### Data Type Selection

| Criterion | Document | List | Map | Stream |
|-----------|----------|------|-----|--------|
| Data model | Single JSON object | Ordered JSON items | Keyed JSON items | Ephemeral JSON messages |
| Max data size | 16 KiB total | 16 KiB per item | 16 KiB per item | 4 KiB per message |
| Max items | 1 (it's one object) | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | N/A (not stored) |
| Access pattern | By name/SID | By index or range | By key | Subscribe only |
| Ordering | N/A | Insertion order (indices) | Lexicographic by key | None guaranteed |
| TTL support | On document | On list + per item | On map + per item | On stream |
| Webhook events | create/update/remove | create/remove + item add/update/remove | create/remove + item add/update/remove | message_published |
| MCP tool coverage | Full CRUD | Most operations (no single-item fetch) | Most operations (no container delete) | Create, list, delete stream + publish message |
| Conflict resolution | Last-write-wins (or If-Match) | Last-write-wins per item | Last-write-wins per item | N/A |

### TTL Strategy

| Scenario | TTL approach | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Call-scoped state | Document TTL = 1 hour | Call won't last longer; auto-cleanup |
| Test validation data | Document TTL = 24 hours | Enough time to inspect, then gone |
| User presence with heartbeat | Map item TTL = 5 min, refresh on heartbeat | Auto-offline if heartbeat stops |
| Activity feed with retention | List TTL = 7 days | Keep recent history, auto-prune |
| Long-lived configuration | No TTL (ttl=0) | Persist until explicitly deleted |
| Keep-alive on active lists | `collectionTtl` on item writes | Parent container stays alive while items flow |

### When to Use If-Match (Conditional Updates)

| Scenario | Use If-Match? | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Multiple writers to same document | Yes | Prevents silent overwrites, detects conflicts |
| Single writer (webhook handler) | No | Only one writer, no conflict possible |
| Append-only list items | No | Each item gets a unique index, no conflicts |
| Map items with known ownership | No | One writer per key, last-write-wins is fine |
| Counter/accumulator patterns | Yes | Read-modify-write needs atomicity |

Note: If-Match requires REST API. MCP tools always use unconditional writes.

## MCP Tool Reference

## Gotchas

### Data & Updates

1. **Updates are full replacement, not merge**: Both Document updates and Map Item updates replace the entire `data` object. If you update a document containing 5 fields with an object containing 1 field, the other 4 fields are permanently lost. Always read-modify-write for partial updates. [Evidence: ETf6783d, lost `version` and `nested` keys]

2. **Map add is not upsert**: `add_sync_map_item` / `create` returns error 54208 if the key already exists. For set-or-create semantics, catch the error and fall back to `update`, or fetch first to decide. [Evidence: MPd79ca1ac, 54208 on duplicate key]

3. **Revision is a string, not an integer**: Revisions look numeric ("0", "1", "2") but are returned as strings in the API. Don't compare with `===` against integers. [Evidence: ETf6783d, revision: "1"]

4. **Empty object `{}` is valid data**: Documents and items can hold empty JSON objects. This is not an error condition. [Evidence: ETc9642713]

### Map Keys

5. **Slashes in Map keys are a trap**: Keys containing `/` can be created successfully but become individually inaccessible — `get`, `update`, and `remove` all fail with "Parameter 'key' is not valid" because the REST API interprets `/` as a URL path separator. These orphaned items are only visible via list or validate operations. Avoid `/` in Map keys entirely. [Evidence: MPd79ca1ac, "key/with/slashes"]

6. **Map key max 320 characters (UTF-8)**: Same limit as UniqueName. Dots, hyphens, underscores, and Unicode characters all work. [Evidence: MPd79ca1ac, "key.with.dots" and "émoji-café-naïve" both OK]

### List Indices

7. **List indices are non-contiguous after deletions**: Deleting an item leaves a permanent gap. New items are appended with indices that may skip values unpredictably. After items 0,1,2 → delete 1 → next item gets index 4, not 1 or 3. Do not use List indices as array positions. [Evidence: ES0251800d, indices 0,2,4 after one deletion]

8. **List indices are never reused**: A deleted index is permanently consumed. Lists are not arrays — they are append-only logs with stable identifiers.

### TTL

9. **TTL enforcement is prompt but not instantaneous**: A 10-second TTL document was gone within 15 seconds. A 30-second TTL empty list was already expired when checked at ~25 seconds. Do not rely on exact-second deletion timing, but expect enforcement within seconds. [Evidence: ETccd0ec2d, EScbba2f88]

10. **`collectionTtl` on item operations resets parent's TTL**: Adding or updating an item with `collectionTtl=N` resets the parent List/Map's expiration to N seconds from the operation time — regardless of the original TTL value. This is a keep-alive mechanism. [Evidence: ES65f9bb08, parent expiry jumped from 22:54:58 to 22:56:42]

11. **`ttl` parameter is an alias**: On containers (List, Map, Stream), `ttl` aliases `collectionTtl`. On items, it aliases `itemTtl`. If both the alias and the specific parameter are provided, the alias is silently ignored. MCP tools expose only the `ttl` param (not `collectionTtl`/`itemTtl`), so via MCP you are always using the alias form. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/api/listitem-resource -->

12. **Item TTL is independent of container TTL**: A List item can have `dateExpires: null` (no item TTL) while the parent List has an active TTL. The item outlives its container's original expiry only if collectionTtl is extended. [Evidence: ES0251800d, items with null dateExpires in list with 300s TTL]

13. **TTL-triggered deletions are free and rate-limit-exempt**: Manual deletes count toward the 20 creates/deletes per second per service limit. TTL-triggered deletions do not. Prefer TTL for cleanup of ephemeral data. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/limits -->

### Webhooks

14. **`webhooksFromRestEnabled` defaults to false**: Webhooks only fire for SDK-originated mutations unless you explicitly enable REST webhook firing on the Sync Service. MCP tool writes are REST writes — they will not trigger webhooks unless this flag is enabled. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/api/service -->

15. **Reachability webhooks fire on hourly rebalancing**: Twilio rebalances connections hourly, generating `endpoint_disconnected` → `endpoint_connected` webhook pairs that are NOT actual user disconnections. Use `reachabilityDebouncingEnabled` with a debounce window to filter these out. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/webhooks -->

### Error Codes

16. **Not-found errors return generic 20404**: Document, List, Map, and item not-found errors all return error code 20404 ("The requested resource was not found"), not Sync-specific codes. The domain CLAUDE.md previously listed incorrect 54xxx codes for not-found errors. [Evidence: live curl tests on nonexistent doc, list, map item]

17. **Know the actual 54xxx codes**: The codes you will encounter in practice: 54006 (entity too large, HTTP 413), 54008 (invalid JSON/request body, HTTP 400), 54103 (revision mismatch on If-Match, HTTP 412), 54208 (duplicate Map key, HTTP 409), 54301 (uniqueName already exists, HTTP 409). [Evidence: all live-verified 2026-03-25]

### Rate Limits

18. **Write rate degrades with payload size**: Sustained 20 writes/s per object for small payloads. At 1 KiB+, limits tighten. At 10 KiB+, you're capped at 2 writes/s. Design accordingly — if you need high write throughput, keep payloads small. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/limits -->

19. **Object creation/deletion rate is per service**: 20 objects/s per service, not per object type. Creating 20 documents/s leaves no room for creating lists or maps in the same second. <!-- verified: twilio.com/docs/sync/limits -->

### MCP-Specific

20. **`created_by` is always "system" for MCP/REST operations**: SDK operations show the token identity. This matters for audit trails and webhook payloads. [Evidence: ETc9642713, created_by: "system"]

21. **MCP `list_sync_list_items` supports order and from**: Unlike some MCP tools that strip query params, the Sync list items tool properly supports `order` (asc/desc) and `from` (index) for pagination. [Evidence: ES0251800d, order=desc returned 4,2,0]
